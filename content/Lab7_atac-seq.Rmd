## Aims

- Import cells from human PBMC scATACseq dataset
- Perform scATACseq quality controls and checks 
- Filter, normalize and plot PBMC scATACseq dataset
- Compute gene activity scores, check known markers and annotate scATAC clusters
- Perform differential peak accessibility analysis

:::

ATAC-seq data may be obtained in isolation using a single-cell ATAC-seq protocol (e.g. [10X scATACseq](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac)) or in combination with gene expression data using a single-cell multiome protocole (e.g. [10X multiome](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression) and [SHARE-seq](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33098772/)). 

Several packages are currently avaialble to process scATAC-seq data in R. These include [Signac](https://satijalab.org/signac/index.html) and [ArchR](https://www.archrproject.com/bookdown/index.html#section). This lab will closely follow the [processing steps](https://satijalab.org/signac/articles/pbmc_vignette.html) outlined in `Signac`, which interfaces well with `Seurat` for single-cell analysis. 

In this lab, we will process a PBMC single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) dataset and perform preliminary analysis to assess quality of these data. The data for this lab comes from [10X Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/10-k-peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells-pbm-cs-from-a-healthy-donor-1-standard-1-0-1). 
The dataset contains roughly ~ 10,000 cells.

### Import data 

Notice how the count matrix is in a `.h5` format. We have already encountered 
this format in [Lab3](../day2/Lab3_Rbioc.qmd). Back then, we imported 
it with `DropletUtils::read10xCounts`. 

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Does this function work here?

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}


```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
DropletUtils::read10xCounts("scATAC/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_filtered_peak_bc_matrix.h5")
```

:::

:::

This works because 10X Genomics make sure to distribute files in `.h5` format 
that are consistent accross single-cell sequencing methodologies. 

However, the `SingleCellExperiment` obtained with this approach is not 
the most convenient, as it cannot natively leverage `fragments` file (see below). 

Instead, we can create a `Signac` object, a flavour of `Seurat` objects. 

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Import counts matrix and feature annotations using an import function provided by `Seurat`.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
library(Seurat)
library(Signac)
library(rtracklayer)
library(stringr)
cnts <- Read10X_h5('scATAC/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_filtered_peak_bc_matrix.h5')
features <- import('scATAC/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_peaks.bed')
features$peak <- as.character(features) |> str_replace(':', '-')
metadata <- read.csv(
  file = "scATAC/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_singlecell.csv",
  header = TRUE,
  row.names = 1
)
```

:::

How many accessible genomic segments were found in this dataset?

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
features
length(features)
```

:::

:::


### Create a `Seurat` object 

The next step is to aggregate `counts` and `features` into a `ChromatinAssay`, 
a scATAC-seq flavour of `Seurat` standard `Assays`.
The documentation for `?CreateChromatinAssay` indicates that the user can provide: 

1. A `fragments` file, corresponding to the full list of all unique fragments mapped across all single cells. 
2. Genomic annotations to the `ChromatinAssay`, corresponding to gene annotations, 
promoter positions, etc. Such annotations can be generated from Ensembl. 

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Generate human annotations from Ensembl using a parsing function from `Seurat`.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
## - Get human gene annotations (hg19/GRCh37) to feed it into the future `ChromatinAssay`
BiocManager::install('EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75')
annotations <- GetGRangesFromEnsDb(ensdb = EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75::EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)
seqlevelsStyle(annotations) <- 'UCSC'
```

:::

Create a `ChromatinAssay` using `counts`, `features`, `fragments` and `annotations`.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
## - Create Chromatin Assay
assay <- Signac::CreateChromatinAssay(
    counts = cnts,
    ranges = features,
    fragments = "scATAC/atac_v1_pbmc_10k_fragments.tsv.gz",
    annotation = annotations,
    genome = "hg19",
    min.cells = 10, 
    min.features = 10
)
assay
```

:::

What are the dimensions of this object? Are they comparable to the count matrix? Comment.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
dim(cnts)
dim(assay)
```

:::

:::

It's finally time to wrap the `ChromatinAssay` into a `Seurat` standard object!
This is done using the `CreateSeuratObject`, as already covered in [Lab6](../day3/Lab6_batch_correction.qmd)

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Create a `Seurat` object from the `ChromatinAssay` object.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
## - Create Seurat object
PBMC <- Seurat::CreateSeuratObject(
    counts = assay,
    assay = 'ATAC', 
    meta.data = metadata[metadata$is__cell_barcode == 1, ]
)
PBMC

PBMC[['ATAC']]
granges(PBMC)
Annotation(PBMC)
```

### Check QCs 

#### Cell-based QCs 

The fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) is a good indicator of how well each 
cell was handled during scATACseq processing. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
PBMC$FRiP <- PBMC$peak_region_fragments / PBMC$passed_filters
PBMC$nCount_ATAC <- colSums(GetAssayData(PBMC, layer = "counts"))
PBMC$nFeature_ATAC <- colSums(GetAssayData(PBMC, layer = "counts") > 0)

quantile(PBMC$FRiP, seq(0, 1, 0.1))
quantile(PBMC$nCount_ATAC, seq(0, 1, 0.1))
quantile(PBMC$nFeature_ATAC, seq(0, 1, 0.1))
```

#### Peaks-based QCs 

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Which analysis are the `fragments` required for, exactly?

Could we still perform normalization/clustering/annotation without them? And motif enrichment analysis?

Since we do have the `fragments` file at hand, most of the QC steps are 
available (e.g. `TSSEnrichment`, `NucleosomeSignal` or fragment size distribution). 
Let's go through them one by one. 

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
# compute nucleosome signal score per cell
PBMC <- NucleosomeSignal(object = PBMC)
PBMC

# compute TSS enrichment score per cell
PBMC <- Signac::TSSEnrichment(object = PBMC, fast = FALSE)
PBMC
```

:::

:::


The `TSSPlot` function from `Signac` can be used to plot the fragment count per peak ~ TSS enrichment. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
PBMC$high.tss <- ifelse(PBMC$TSS.enrichment > 3.5, 'High', 'Low')
TSSPlot(PBMC, group.by = 'high.tss') + NoLegend()
PBMC$high.tss <- ifelse(PBMC$TSS.enrichment > 2.5, 'High', 'Low')
TSSPlot(PBMC, group.by = 'high.tss') + NoLegend()
```

The `FragmentHistogram` function from `Signac` can be used to plot the fragment size distribution in peaks with different nucleosome signals. 

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Group genomic loci by their nucleosome signal (> 4 or < 4) and plot the fragment size distribution.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
PBMC$nucleosome_group <- ifelse(PBMC$nucleosome_signal > 4, 'NS > 4', 'NS < 4')
FragmentHistogram(object = PBMC, group.by = 'nucleosome_group')
```

:::

:::


### Filter cells and features 

Just like standard scRNAseq data, scATACseq data needs to be filtered to remove 
low-quality cells and peaks. 

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Filter the `Seurat` object (cells and features) as deemed appropriate.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
## - Filter data 
PBMC <- subset(PBMC, subset = nCount_ATAC > 3000 & nCount_ATAC < 100000) 
PBMC <- subset(PBMC, subset = nFeature_ATAC > 1000 & nFeature_ATAC < 20000) 
PBMC <- subset(PBMC, subset = FRiP > 0.30) 
PBMC

## - Remove peaks with low coverage
PBMC <- PBMC[rowSums(GetAssayData(PBMC, layer = "counts")) > 10, ]
PBMC <- PBMC[rowSums(GetAssayData(PBMC, layer = "counts") > 0) > 10, ]
PBMC
```

:::

:::


### Dimensionality reduction and clustering

Now that the dataset is filtered, we can proceed to data normalization, dimensionality reduction and clustering.
Compared to scRNAseq, scATACseq data is much sparser and has a higher dimensionality. This has important implications for the choice of normalization and dimensionality reduction methods. scATACseq data are generally normalized using a `TF-IDF` normalization, which is implemented in the `RunTFIDF` function in `Signac`, and dimensionality reduction is performed using `LSI` (Latent Semantic Indexing) implemented in the `RunSVD` function.

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Normalize then further reduce the dimensionality for visualization purposes.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
## - Normalize data 
PBMC <- RunTFIDF(PBMC) 

## - Reduce dimensionality
PBMC <- FindTopFeatures(PBMC, min.cutoff = 'q50') 
PBMC <- RunSVD(PBMC) 

## - Embed in 2D UMAP
PBMC <- RunUMAP(object = PBMC, reduction = 'lsi', dims = 2:30)

## - Cluster cells
PBMC <- FindNeighbors(object = PBMC, reduction = 'lsi', dims = 2:30)
PBMC <- FindClusters(object = PBMC, verbose = FALSE, algorithm = 3)

## - Visualize data 
DimPlot(PBMC, label = TRUE) + NoLegend()
```

:::


What can you observe in the `UMAP` projection of the dataset? Comment on the separation of some cell types into different spatially-resolved clusters.


:::


## Compute gene activity scores

Signac's `GeneActivity()` function require scATACseq fragment information. Since 
we have them, we can estimate a gene activity score for each gene in the `annotations`.

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
gene.activities <- GeneActivity(PBMC)
```

We can now save this new object as an `Assay` in the `PBMC` object and normalize it.

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
PBMC[['RNA']] <- CreateAssayObject(counts = gene.activities)

# - Normalize the new RNA assay.
PBMC <- NormalizeData(object = PBMC, assay = 'RNA', normalization.method = 'LogNormalize', scale.factor = median(PBMC$nCount_RNA))
PBMC
```

One can now visualize expression of individual markers across clusters to infer 
cluster identity. 

::: {.callout-question .icon .callout-note}

Assess the expression of known markers across clusters, projecting the cells in a 2D UMAP.

::: {.callout-answer .icon .callout-note collapse=true}

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
VlnPlot(
  object = PBMC,
  features = c(
    'MS4A1', # B-cell
    'CD3D', # T-cell
    'NKG7', # NK cell
    'TREM1' # Monocytes
  ), 
  assay = "RNA"
)
PBMC$annotation <- dplyr::case_when(
  Idents(PBMC) %in% c(0, 5, 9, 12) ~ "Monocytes", 
  Idents(PBMC) %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10) ~ "T-cells", 
  Idents(PBMC) %in% c(6) ~ "NK-cells", 
  Idents(PBMC) %in% c(8, 11) ~ "B-cells", 
  Idents(PBMC) %in% c(13, 14) ~ "DC"
)
DimPlot(PBMC, group.by = 'annotation', label = TRUE) + NoLegend()
```

:::

:::

## Find peaks differentially accessible across clusters

Finally, we can perform differential peak accessibility analysis to identify peaks that are differentially accessible between clusters. This is done using the `FindMarkers` function in `Signac`, which is similar to `FindAllMarkers` in `Seurat`.

```{r, eval = TRUE, filename = "R"}
Idents(PBMC) <- PBMC$annotation
da_peaks <- FindMarkers(
  object = PBMC,
  ident.1 = "Monocytes",
  ident.2 = "B-cells",
  test.use = 'LR',
  latent.vars = 'nCount_ATAC'
)
VlnPlot(
  object = PBMC,
  features = rownames(da_peaks)[1],
  pt.size = 0.1,
  idents = c("Monocytes","B-cells")
)
```
